    <h3>A Hawaiian Twist on a Japanese Dessert</h3>
    <p>My family has been making mochi for generations, as a Japanese tradition to bring in every New Year. Japanese mochi
        can be made a few different ways, but our favorite is chichi dango. Making and eating mochi brings my and many
        other local families lots of joy and memories every year and it's made mochi one of my favorite desserts.

    <p>Poi is a revered Hawaiian food made from the root of the kalo(taro) plant. Kalo is believed to be the very first
        ancestor of Hawaiians, which makes it sacred and special to the Hawaiian people. It can be enjoyed with many different 
        types of foods and recpes.

    <p>A few years ago, my mom and I were cooking at my aunty's house and craving something sweet. My aunty had leftover poi
        in the fridge and we thought it was the perfect opportunity to try making poi mochi. It was delicious and sweet, and now
        we make it every time we get together.
