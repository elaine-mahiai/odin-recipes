    <h3>My Favorite Hawaiian Style Shoyu Chicken Recipe</h3>
    <p>Shoyu chicken is a recipe that's been passed down through generations in Hawaii for decades.
        With just four ingredients, it's an easy-to-make but delicious to eat meal that satisfies a savory craving.</p>
    <p>I've tried shoyu chicken from dozens of different places but my favorite will always be from my mom's kitchen.
        The recipe is simple but effective and I can't wait for you to all try it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds frozen bone-in chicken thighs with skin on</li>
            <li>1 cup shoyu (soy sauce)</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>Few slices of ginger</li>
        </ul>
    <p><em>Tip: This recipe tastes best with Aloya shoyu, but you can use low sodium kikoman if it's not available.</em></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Once boiling, bring heat down to medium and cover the pot.</li>

            <li>Flip again and cook for 20 minutes. Repeat once more for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><em>Optional: Remove one cup of liquid from the pot and pour into a small saucepan. 
                Add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and mix until cornstarch is dissolved and sauce is thickened.
                Pour thickened sauce over chicken when serving.
