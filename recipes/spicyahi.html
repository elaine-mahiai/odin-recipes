        <h4>My Favorite Spicy Ahi Recipe</h4>
            <p>Poke is a traditional Hawaiian dish eaten on its own or as an appetizer. Poke means "cubed" in Hawaiian
                so this dish is literally just cubed fish. Throughout the years, locals have made all kinds of 
                different poke recipes with Japanese influence. Various ingredients have been added and mixed in and 
                it's now a dish enjoyed worldwide. 
        </p>
            <p>Spicy Ahi poke uses a spicy creamy sauce and is best served on its own or with rice. This recipe is my favorite
                variation but feel free to experiment and make it your own!
